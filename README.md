# Advent JS
This repo is based on [adventJs](https://adventjs.dev/), the algoritmia challenge created by @midudev.

## Development methodology
The challenge is created fully with Test Driven Development, so we make sure our solutions are trying to cover as many edge cases as possible.

## Stack
The tests are made on [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). So if you would like to contribute to the project, take a look to the documentation

## Contribution
In order to contribute, I would you to follow simple but essential rules
- You should solve the problems using TDD
- If you want to delete some tests, please just comment the code. Those tests might be important for future code readers
- Create your branch and have fun practicing TDD
